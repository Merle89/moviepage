# Movie Trailer Website
Movie Page is a simple script to store my favourite movies (including movie title, poster URL and a YouTube link to the movie trailer) and to generate a website that displays these movies. It is a project for the <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004" target="_blank">Udacity's full-stack nanodegree program</a>. 

# Required Libraries and Dependencies
